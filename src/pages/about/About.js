              A Child's Leg is Saved with the Help of Integra Dermal
              Regeneration Template (IDRT)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Margo Casselman was only 8 years old in 2000 when a horrific car
              accident nearly led to the amputation of her leg. Her leg was
              broken in numerous places, and her skin had been stripped from the
              muscles and bones underneath. For most doctors who examined her,
              amputation of her injured leg seemed the only option. But Margoâ€™s
              parents were determined to save her leg if possible.
